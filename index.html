      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>Hello, my name is Kyel White. I was born and raised in Harlem, NYC. I moved to Scranton, PA when I was 15 (yes,
        just like the office), where I received my Bachelors degree from East Stroudsburg University. In my free time I
        enjoy exploring local museums, plant nurseries, boxing, running and cinematography.</p>
